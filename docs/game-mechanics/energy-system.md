# Energy System

Energy is the core resource that powers all farming activities in RiceRise. Understanding how to manage and optimize your energy usage is crucial for successful farming.

## Energy Basics

### What is Energy?
Energy represents your farmer's stamina and ability to perform farming tasks. Every action in RiceRise consumes energy, making it a valuable and limited resource.

### Energy Pool
- **Maximum Energy**: 100 points (base level)
- **Starting Energy**: 100 points for new players
- **Regeneration Rate**: 1 point per minute
- **Full Regeneration**: 100 minutes (1 hour 40 minutes)

## Energy Costs

### Core Farming Actions

| Action | Energy Cost | Description |
|--------|-------------|-------------|
| **Planting Seeds** | 10 | Plant any type of seed |
| **Watering Crops** | 5 | Water a single plot |
| **Harvesting** | 15 | Harvest mature crops |
| **Plot Clearing** | 3 | Clear withered crops |

### Advanced Actions (Future Features)

| Action | Energy Cost | Description |
|--------|-------------|-------------|
| **Tool Maintenance** | 8 | Repair farming tools |
| **Fertilizing** | 7 | Apply fertilizer to crops |
| **Pest Control** | 6 | Remove pests from plots |
| **Land Expansion** | 20 | Unlock new farm plots |

## Energy Management Strategies

### Efficient Energy Usage

#### Planning Your Actions
1. **Calculate total energy needed** for your farming session
2. **Prioritize high-value actions** (harvesting > planting > watering)
3. **Batch similar actions** to minimize context switching
4. **Reserve emergency energy** (20-30 points) for urgent needs

#### Optimal Action Sequences
```
Example 8-Hour Farming Session:
1. Harvest ready crops (45 energy) → +1,200 RT
2. Water withering crops (20 energy) → Prevent losses
3. Plant new seeds (30 energy) → Future income
4. Reserve 5 energy for emergencies
```

### Energy Regeneration

#### Natural Regeneration
- **Rate**: 1 energy per minute
- **Continuous**: Works even when offline
- **Maximum**: Caps at your maximum energy limit
- **Free**: No cost or resources required

#### Regeneration Timing
- **Short breaks**: 5-10 minutes for small actions
- **Lunch break**: 30-60 minutes for medium sessions
- **Overnight**: 8+ hours for full regeneration
- **Work day**: Plan around your schedule

## Energy Optimization

### Daily Energy Budget

#### Morning Session (7-9 AM)
- **Available**: 100 energy (full overnight regen)
- **Actions**: Harvest overnight crops, plant new seeds
- **Reserve**: 20 energy for midday watering

#### Midday Check (12-2 PM)
- **Available**: 40-60 energy (5-7 hours regen)
- **Actions**: Water crops, quick harvests
- **Reserve**: 15 energy for evening session

#### Evening Session (6-8 PM)
- **Available**: 60-80 energy (4-6 hours regen)
- **Actions**: Major harvesting, new plantings
- **Reserve**: 10 energy for overnight emergencies

### Advanced Techniques

#### Energy Stacking
- **Plan ahead**: Know when you'll have full energy
- **Coordinate actions**: Align with crop readiness
- **Maximize efficiency**: Use full energy pools effectively

#### Energy Banking
- **Save energy**: Don't always use maximum
- **Strategic reserves**: Keep energy for opportunities
- **Emergency funds**: Always have 20+ energy available

## Energy Boosters

### Types of Boosters

#### Energy Potions
- **Small Potion**: +25 energy (150 RT)
- **Medium Potion**: +50 energy (280 RT)
- **Large Potion**: +100 energy (500 RT)
- **Instant**: Immediate effect

#### Energy Upgrades
- **Energy Capacity**: Increase maximum energy
- **Regeneration Rate**: Faster energy recovery
- **Efficiency**: Reduce action costs
- **Permanent**: One-time purchase, lasting effect

### When to Use Boosters

#### High-Value Situations
- **Rare seed planting**: Don't miss opportunities
- **Event participation**: Limited-time bonuses
- **Competitive farming**: Leaderboard pushes
- **Emergency harvesting**: Prevent crop loss

#### Cost-Benefit Analysis
```
Energy Potion ROI Calculation:
Cost: 280 RT (Medium Potion)
Energy Gained: 50 points
Potential Actions: 3 harvests + 1 planting
Expected Return: 600-900 RT
Net Profit: 320-620 RT (114-221% ROI)
```

## Energy Efficiency Tips

### Maximize Your Energy

#### Smart Scheduling
- **Align with real life**: Match gaming to your schedule
- **Use natural breaks**: Check during work/school breaks
- **Set reminders**: Don't waste regeneration time
- **Plan sessions**: Know what you'll do before logging in

#### Action Prioritization
1. **Harvest first**: Prevent withering, immediate returns
2. **Water critical crops**: Maintain quality
3. **Plant strategically**: Consider timing and energy
4. **Save energy**: Don't spend everything immediately

#### Efficiency Metrics
Track your energy efficiency:
- **Energy per RT**: How much energy for each token earned
- **Actions per session**: Maximize productive actions
- **Waste minimization**: Avoid hitting energy cap
- **ROI tracking**: Monitor return on energy investment

## Common Energy Mistakes

### Energy Waste
- **Hitting the cap**: Losing regeneration time
- **Poor planning**: Running out mid-session
- **Panic spending**: Using energy inefficiently
- **Ignoring priorities**: Wrong action order

### Solutions
- **Set timers**: Check before hitting cap
- **Plan ahead**: Know your energy needs
- **Stay calm**: Think before acting
- **Prioritize**: Harvest > Water > Plant
